Creating a Bar or Histogram Visualization You can use this code to create a bar or histogram visualization of the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable in your population dataset. For example, you can visualize the distribution of ages or gender in the population.

This project allows you to create a bar chart to visualize the age distribution within a population dataset. It's a tool for gaining insights into the age demographics of a population.
